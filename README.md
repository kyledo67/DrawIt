# handtracker

Just a fun project made cause I saw it on tiktok, which essentially tracks someones hand and enables users to draw using your finger tips.

User must enter a "pinching" position with their fingers as if holding a pencil, then move your hand around in that position to draw. 

Click 'q' to quit, 'c' to clear screen(remove any drawings), 'r' to change color to red, 'g' for green, and 'b' for blue.
